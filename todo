a) Const and  append T to types. All over.
b) Make is not triggered when a header file is changed.
c) Static thread analyzer.
d) Destructors everywhere ?? C++ is a pain in the keester!
f) Remove all literals.


a) Worker should log when it start and ends a task.
b) Remove all initiators. Server side sort logic should be in main.
c) Client side. Timeout and lastReply. Timeout should be in the config file.
d) Read task and read reply in protocol.cpp should be redone. Nope!
e) Dispatch should have its own thread to handle network IO
f) Move all logs to the logs directory
h) APIs on either side.
i) Protocol layer tests! Test if 2 successive tasks or results are properly
   read! Not necessary. Good to have, though!
j) Performance issues. On the client side, it may be desirable to signal 
   the threads to quit when we know the queue is empty. There *maybe*
   something to be gained by making sure the sizes of files to a merge task
   are somewhat equal.
